The Creative Content Generator is a Streamlit-based application designed to produce high-quality text and images from simple prompts, leveraging OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo and DALL·E APIs for flexible, creative content production. This project allows users to generate stories, poems, ad copy, social captions, and custom images, streamlining creative workflows for individuals, businesses, and educators.[1][2]

 Project Description

Creative Content Generator democratizes access to advanced AI content creation by providing a simple, tab-based web app. Users enter a topic or prompt and receive either structured text (story, poem, ad copy, caption) or AI-generated visuals via DALL·E. The application integrates environment-based API key management for security and reliability and includes user-friendly error handling for accessible operation.[2]

The core technologies are:

- Streamlit for rapid and interactive UI deployment.
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for diverse, human-like text content generation.
- OpenAI DALL·E for image synthesis based on textual descriptions.
- python-dotenv for secure API key management.

The intuitive layout and workflow make it ideal for non-technical and technical users alike, expanding creative capacity with minimal effort.
